# penedroid
PeneDroid is an FTP-only exploitation framework. This is a work in progress and is written in Python. The website, 
penedroid.16mb.com, is also under construction and has the dates a bit off. Finally, this is a first framework written,
just to see if I could do it.
Remember to change the cwd.txt file to the path of the main.py file. Ex: /sdcard/penedroid/framework
